# pypong
This is a python based pong game I made using pygame.  This is meant to be a 2 player game played on the same computer.  Player 1 controls the left side paddle and player 2 controls the right side.  Player 1 uses the "W" and "S" keys while player 2 uses the "Up Arrow" and "Down Arrow" keys to control the paddles' up and down movements.  Press the spacebar to start a game.  First to 5 points is the winner.  Press space after a game has ended to start another one.  Periodically throughout the game there will be a small powerup.  Your paddle will get bigger upon obtaining the powerup, giving you an advantage.  The powerup goes away after the player scores a point.  As the ball is hit back it will get slightly faster, giving both players a challenge!

Enjoy!
